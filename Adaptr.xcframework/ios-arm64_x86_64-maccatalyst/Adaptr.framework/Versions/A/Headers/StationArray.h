/**
  Search through the stations in this array and return one that has
  options that match those passed in via optionKeysAndValues. This differs from
  `getStationWithOptionKey:Value:` in that you can specify multiple key/value
  pairs.
 
  This method returns the first station with the matching values, or nil.
 
  A sample query might look like this:
 
     [stations getStationWithOptions: @{ @"genre": @"80s", @"bpm" : @"slow" }
 
  When run against stations with the following options values:
 
     stationA.options = @{ @"genre": @"80s", @"bpm": @"fast" };
     stationB.options = @{ @"genre": @"90s", @"bpm": @"slow" };
     stationC.options = @{ @"genre": @"80s", @"bpm": @"slow", @"something": @"else" };
     stationD.options = @{ @"genre": @"90s" };
 
  this method would return `stationC`.
 
  When an option value is an array, this method will look for an element in the
  array that matches the search value.
 
  The following station would match the query above:
 
     stationE.options = @{ @"genre": @[ @"80s", @"hip-hop", @"rap" ], @"bpm": @"slow" };
 
  @param optionKeysAndValues key value pairs to search for
  @return the first station whose options contain optionKeysAndValues or nil
 */

- (Station *) getStationWithOptions: (NSDictionary *) optionKeysAndValues;

/**
  Similar to `getStationWithOptions:`, but this method returns all the stations
  that match the passed in `optionsKeysAndValues` rather than just the first.
 
 see `getStationWithOptions:` for the format of `optionsKeysAndValues`
 
  @param optionKeysAndValues key value pairs to search for (see `getStationWithOptions:`)
  @return an array of stations whose options contain optionKeysAndValues. never nil.
 */

- (StationArray *) getAllStationsWithOptions: (NSDictionary *) optionKeysAndValues;

/**
 * Search the stations in this array and return the first one with the
 * given name.
 *
 * @param name name of station to look for
 * @return the first station whose name matches
 */
